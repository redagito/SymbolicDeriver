# SymbolicDeriver

Symbolic deriver for simple mathematical formulas.
The formula is represented as a node tree and implements the visitor pattern for printing and deriving formulas.

Functionality is limited but can be extended by adding additional node types and corresponding implementations in the visitor classes.

# TODO

[] Implement the expression parser which builds node trees from formula strings
[] Implement additional node types
[] Unit tests
